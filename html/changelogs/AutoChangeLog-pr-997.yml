  - rscadd: Craftable Pipebomb made with plasma cell
  - rscadd: HESH Rockets. RPG-7 package starts with 4 out of 12 rockets being HESH.
      HESH rocket have worse blast but send a lot of fragments to the other side of
      a room.
  - rscadd: White phosphorus grenades, accessible to traitor for now.
  - tweak: Normal HE Rocket nerfed a bit, upstream parity. Still kill with a direct
      hit.
  - tweak: Stinger Grenades sprite changed to match upstream, fragmentation grenades
      now cause a 2 tiles small blast around itself.
  - tweak: Grenades dropping on someone from above should now bonk off someone's head.
  - tweak: Grenade fragments now ricochet making them much deadlier, especially in
      small room.
  - tweak: Grenade now generally produce 1/3 the fragment but deals 3x the damage.
      Upstream parity, slight buff, frag grenades and pipebomb has a blast radius
      of 2x. Grenade deadliness against unarmored people is practically unchanged,
      grenade deadliness against CAS Voidsuit / Deepflare goes from 0 damage to 110
      at 0 - 1 tile range, rapidly dropping off to 11 - 30 at 2 - 3 tiles range.
  - tweak: Fire stacks are much deadlier, approximately by 2x, making being on fire
      less ignorable. They also put themselves out slowly.
  - tweak: Falling item that deals less than 5 damage won't knock you down anymore
      (Tiny and Small Item)
  - bugfix: A crash that can happen with grenade launcher launched grenade.
