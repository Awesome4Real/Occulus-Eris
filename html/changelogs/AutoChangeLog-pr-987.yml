changes:
  - bugfix: Toxin reference in code no longer mistakenly adds tar, a toxin 40x as
      deadly as baseline toxin. This mean that maint food, microwave burnt mess, some
      random plants, rejected organs, incompatible blood, maint loot etc. no longer
      give tar but give baseline toxin.
  - bugfix: Phoron splash on people cause chemical burns again, phoron spilled on
      ground cause phoron gas to appear potentially causing fire and atmos alarm,
      phoron splashed on people increase the fire stack.
