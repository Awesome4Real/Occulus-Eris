changes:
  - rscadd: Diving. Hold C in hotkey mode while moving to dive in any direction. You
      can dive on tables, railings, and low walls. Diving into glass hurts you, but
      it also hurts the glass. (You'll get hurt more than the glass does)
  - rscadd: RIG ricochets. Your RIGs can now deflect bullets.
  - rscadd: Throwing knives. Craft them.
  - rscadd: Cover rework, low walls, tables, and security barricades now block bullets
      somewhat more immersively.
  - rscadd: Bullets now travel up and down stairs.
  - rscadd: In order to accommodate diving, you can now hold items while laying down.
      You are unable to attack or use items while laying down, however. There is also
      now a delay for getting up from laying down.
