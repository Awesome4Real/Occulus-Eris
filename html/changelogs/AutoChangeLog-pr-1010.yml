changes:
  - rscadd: A new forgotten lesson breakdown that hits your stat across the board
      between 2 to 5, a (weaker) mirror to "A Lesson Learnt" positive breakdown.
  - tweak: Tweaked the breakdown system. Now you cannot roll a negative breakdown
      on first try. Instead, negative breakdown occurs as a result of getting a normal
      breakdown with objective but failing to fulfill the objective. If you don't
      get any breakdown with objective, there's nothing you need to do.
